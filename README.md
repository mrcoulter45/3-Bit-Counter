# 3-Bit Counter
This is a 3-bit counter project I made because I was interested in trying my hand at a custon PCB. The PCB was made by JLCPCB, and turned out really good. The counter operates via NAND and D flip-flop ICs, the Arduino Nano is used simply for a clk signal to the chips. 
The 3-bit counter consists of:
- x4 MH7420 (SN7420N / NTE7420) DUAL 4-INPUT NAND 7420 ICs
- x2 CD4013B CMOS Dual D-Type Flip-Flop ICs
- x1 Arduino Nano
- x3 5mm blue LEDs
- x3 220Î© resistors
- x2 10nf monolithic capacitors
- x2 100nf monolithic capacitors
- PCB

## 3-Bit Counter v1
Here is the first version of the counter that I made with a PCB milling machine. It was much more difficult to make, in that I had to solder every pin on both sides of the PCB, as well as solder wires to both sides of the PCB for every via. It doesn't work so well because it doesn't have capacitors and the copper became very corroded over time.
