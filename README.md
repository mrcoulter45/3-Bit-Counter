# 3-Bit Counter
This is a 3-bit counter project I made because I was interested in trying my hand at a custon PCB. The PCB was made by JLCPCB, and turned out really good. The counter operates via NAND and D flip-flop ICs, the Arduino Nano is used simply for a clk signal to the chips. 
The 3-bit counter consists of:
- x4 MH7420 (SN7420N / NTE7420) DUAL 4-INPUT NAND 7420 ICs
- x2 CD4013B CMOS Dual D-Type Flip-Flops
- x1 Arduino Nano
- x3 5mm blue LEDs
- x3 220Î© resistors
- x2 10nf capacitors
- x2 100nf capacitors
- PCB
